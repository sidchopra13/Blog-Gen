## Description

Hey! Welcome to Blog Gen! This is just a blog web application I built from learning how to develop full-stack applications. 
I was able to learn how the front-end and back-end interact along with a database, and it's turned out very well!

This web app uses Node.js for backend. I have used Express.js for serving static files, using middlewares and generating URL's for blogs with routes. The main part of the app is based on EJS, which is a template engine. As soon as you publish the blog, it gets saved on the MongoDB database with Mongoose and a new `div` is generated for your blogs. A new URL is also generated, as `/posts/your-title` by which you can access your blog. The compose blog page can be found at `/compose/`. All the blogs are saved on a MongoDB database, which is served with MongoDB Atlas service. All these CRUD operations are carried out on MongoDB with Mongoose.
